      <p class="text-body-1">
        Welcome to the Financial Preferences section. This part helps us
        understand your financial goals and concerns better. Here's a quick
        overview of what we'll ask:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-body-2 mt-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Investment Preferences:</strong> These are the types of
          investments you're interested in, like stocks, bonds, or real estate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Investment Restrictions:</strong> Any limitations you have on
          where your money is invested, often based on personal or ethical
          considerations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Insurance Coverage:</strong> The types of insurance you're
          looking for to protect your assets and loved ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional Concerns:</strong> Any other financial matters
          you'd like to discuss or have questions about.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-body-2 mt-2">
        Don't worry if you're unsure about some options - we're here to guide
        you through the process and explain anything that's unclear.
